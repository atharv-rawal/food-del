food-del-db is the folder which contains the dumped database that we have used using mongodump

to get this inside of your computer to get a better experience and see that data (food items, images and descriptions, user accounts etc..)

	>> mongorestore --db food-del-db --dir=C:\Path\to\food-del\food-del-db

Note : mongodb tools need to be installed in your computer to use the mongodump and mongorestore commands

the database should work off the bat, using default localhost port for mongodb

Thank you
